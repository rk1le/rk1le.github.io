  <h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
  <p>This is my very first website for ISTM 310. I created it using simple HTML and hosted it using GitHub Pages.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Ryan, and I am a Junior at Texas A&M University majoring in Management Information Systems. I enjoy learning about technology, business, and how they connect in the real world. In my free time, I love watching and playing sports, especially basketball and golf.</p>

  <h2>How I Built This Website</h2>
  <p>I used GitHub to create a new repository for my website files. A repository is like a folder that stores my project online. Inside that folder, I added this HTML file and saved it using a commit, which records changes I make to the project. I worked on the main branch, which is the main version of my website. Once I committed my changes and pushed them to GitHub, I turned on GitHub Pages to make my site live on the internet. Each time I update and commit changes, my website automatically refreshes online.</p>

  <h2>My Learning Experience</h2>
  <p>This assignment helped me understand the basics of how websites are created and shared. I learned how GitHub can be used not just for code, but also for hosting websites. It was exciting to see my work appear on a real web link that anyone can visit!</p>
